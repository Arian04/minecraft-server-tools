# minecraft-server-tools
This repo includes various tools I use for hosting containerized minecraft servers. 
More comprehensive tools exist, but I wanted something much more minimal. 

## Features
- None yet lol

## TODO
- basic Dockerfile
- scripts
	- mc jar downloader
		- Fabric
		- Purpur
		- Velocity (proxy)
	- substitute env vars into config files
		- TODO: make list of files here
	- set up backups to a directory that is intended to be exposed as a volume on the container host
